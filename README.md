👋 Hello, I’m @yazanelmahmoud, a Computer Engineering student at UTC - Sorbonne University, with a passion for diving deep into the world of software development and systems engineering. Fluent in French, English, and Arabic, I bring a unique global perspective to my work.

🔍 My technical expertise includes a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C, and SQL, along with web development skills in HTML and CSS. These skills are complemented by my hands-on experience in software engineering principles and my dedication to mastering the intricacies of both front-end and back-end development.

🌟 During a 6-month program at the Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna, I specialized in Electronic Engineering for Intelligent Vehicles, where I developed a keen interest in integrating innovative software solutions in complex engineering systems.

📚 I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and stay abreast of the latest technological advancements. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge projects that challenge the status quo and leverage technology to solve real-world problems.

🤝 I’m eager to collaborate on projects that allow me to apply my technical skills and knowledge in practical, impactful ways. I value diverse perspectives and believe that my multicultural background enhances my ability to innovate and collaborate effectively.

📫 You can reach me at yaz.mahmou@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. I’m always open to discussing new projects, opportunities, and ideas.
